# Background Information
The airline industry has grown into one of the world’s important industries having a direct impact on the world economy. However, the airline industry is also characterized by the presence of strong competition among the carriers. In addition, the industry faces rapid changes due to technology innovations, increased costs due to fuel price hikes and increased regulatory requirements. In such a competitive environment, airlines that have optimum aircraft utilization and on time performance get an advantage on the airline’s economic perspective and customer satisfaction.
A recent industry analysis in the USA has indicated that the worst airline delays occur during the summer travel season. Each year, a record number of travelers turn up at the airports for leisure travel during the summer season. It was reported that the airlines in the USA operated more than 1 million flights between July and August 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). As a result of this increased demand, airlines are prone to delays during this season due to various reasons.
For an airline, an aircraft is a very expensive asset. State of the art aircrafts cost several million dollars a month in lease payments alone. As a result, airlines tend to operate with the least number of aircrafts with each aircraft utilized optimally with higher on-air times and lower turnaround times at the airport. Since the airlines operate with the minimum number of aircrafts, a delay in one flight segment can have a propagation effect of delaying several other flights that utilize the same aircraft. In case of a delay in departure, the airlines do not have freedom

Analysis Questions:
1. In what areas is Berry Airlines performing better than Acorn Airlines?
  a. Performance measures: optimum aircraft usage and on time performance  
  b. What is the average proportion in the amount of time planes spend in the air compared to the amount of time planes spend in the terminal (for both berry and acorn)
    i. We look at air time of each airplane → take the average of airplane total air time for each airline → longer air time within the same period means greater efficiency
  c. Possible Scheduling Issue
  d. Average Taxi in/ Taxi out time for each airline
  f. Negatives
    i. Average Delay in Departure and Arrival Time for each Airline
    ii. Percentage/Ratio of flights that are early, punctual, delayed
    iii. Total number of cancellations for each airline
2. What are the factors contributing to arrival delays for Acorn Airlines and how do they compare against Berry Airlines?
  a. What is the effect of ___ on arrival delays? -> total arrival delay time
    i. Airline Delay
    ii. Weather Delay
    iii. NAS Delay
    iv. Security Delay
    v. Late Aircraft Delay
  b. Verify Significance:
    i. Compare based on tail number and different types of delays
    ii. Compare the tail number with flights to verify if the delay is caused by the plane
3. Identify course of action Acorn Airlines should take to better its performance against Berry Airlines

Keep in View:
- Weekends vs weekdays
- Distance and airtime
- See if length of flights affect overall airline performance
- See which airport got the most delays?
- Diversion of flights (for recommendation if the airplance is the one causing many flight delay(like is the airplane spoil not weather)
